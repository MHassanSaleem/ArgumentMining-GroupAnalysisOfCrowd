jwhitewater,"Alan, countries with 300 million people struggle to absorb refugee / immigrant populations of tens of thousands. look at Germany . to expect Israel to absorb nearly 100% of its current population, comprised of people they’re still at war with, is preposterous."
boomboxheto,"#CleanseOurCourts so we don't become like UK, Germany & Canada where common Citizens are suffering and their taxes being used to provide a Luxurious life to illegal immigrants and Refugees ! Throw the Bangladeshis and Rohingyas out so Bharat doesn't become a Sharia land! https:// twitter.com/AmyMek/status/ 1062933370957635586 …"
Strick_heldin,"All immigrants into a country are refugees ? I don't think that's right. My ancestors came from Scotland and Spain and were no refugees , just settled down in Germany ."
yoDeeeej,Germany won’t be there in 20 years. It will be overrun by refugees well before that... but These immigrants just want refuge... they don’t want to overrun the country or anything
RandyBowen62,Immigrants should NOT be allowed to vote until they become citizens. I spent 3 years in Germany and I wasn’t allowed to vote in their elections not that I wanted to. What happens in America should not be up to immigrants or refugees . Want a say in what happens? Work 2ba citizen

marvelousfiasco,"Germany again. She wants to create European Nazis. If she didn’t open border Europe was much better and safety place. Because she wanted to have army, she brought refugees immigrants . Everything is on her plan. But Only Trump was not her plan. https://www. westmonster.com/merkel-we-need -real-true-eu-army/ …"
dearhigh,"How many nations? We are a country of immigrants . Canada, Germany , France, Ireland, India, Italy, Lithuania, Mexico, Russia, UK, Native American, China are part of my American Family. There's also a Refugee / Immigrant in my family too,"
stinginthetail,"this is pretty easily disproved - right from first assertion - Germany to take 1.5 million refugees . No they aren't. They took 1.5 m over 3 yrs. In population of 100m, 12% immigrants , it's not a big deal."
hutchinson,"Germany and Sweden wouldn’t have to take in millions of refugees of the US didn’t cap their intake at 20,000. That issue is way too complicated to tackle here but I can tell you for a fact that immigrants commit less crime than native born citizens in the US."
Christianthings,Merkel of Germany a DISGRACE to Germany .... places german people last after all other immigrants and refugees from all kinds of UNCIVILIZED Places and People.. shame..shame...shame... https://www. facebook.com/redemptionapos tolicnetwork/posts/2283048708374817 …

brian480480,Good idea for France to tool up their military. Do it. Germany too. We can pull back a little. Problem with France is they'll recruit all the immigrant refugees and give them guns and training. They have little or no loyalty to France.
StageYaneu,WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE OUR COUNTRY WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE THE OF START OF USA! MOVE TO THE MIDDLE EAST OR SOMEWHERE THAT ALLOWS DICTATORS TO FLOURISH. YOUR RELATIVES ARE IMMIGRANTS / REFUGEES FROM GERMANY OR WHEREVER. BACKDATE YOUR REFUGEE PROGRAM & GET THE HELL OUT OF USA!
MicronautCA,What a message in a bottle from 1939 tells us about the modern world's treatment of immigrants : the rejection of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany on the SS St Louis was later described as having given Hitler 'the green light for the Final Solution'. https://www. independent.co.uk/news/long_read s/message-bottle-ss-st-louis-voyage-damned-canada-apology-immigrants-jews-holocaust-hitler-trump-a8617271.html …
cothamboy54,"In Germany the Green Party share of the vote has increased from 8 to 24% in the past two years. Greens are seen as the clear Left alternative to RW populism. They are pro EU, pro environment and have a clear policy on refugees and immigrants . A model for the UK Green party? https:// twitter.com/cothamboy54/st atus/1061122494512488448 …"
OrwellvsTrump,"Dear Germany , Britain, Dutch, Estonia, Poland, Italy, NoGoLands, and assorted countries Americans forget, Please let us know your parade schedules at http:// whitehouse.gov c/o John Bolton who'll do anything to get away from immigrants and refugees . Thank you, USA Americans"
